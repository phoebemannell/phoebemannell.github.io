**Intro to Bash Command Line and Counting and Mining Research Data with Unix**

The [Bash Command Line](http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/intro-to-bash) and [Data Mining](http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/research-data-with-unix) tutorials probably should have been tutorial #1. Oh my god my life would have been so much easier if I had learned these things systematically at an earlier point. I know Shawn has already stated that he meant to have this earlier in the lesson plan, but it is definitely a necessary opening lesson for those planning on working in digital history. I have bookmarked both of them and have gone back several times to refresh in my mind the linguistics of working in command line. 

Using terminal is like crafting a custom cabinet. It would be easier and faster to go to IKEA, buying a dresser, and assembling it in an afternoon, but if you built your own from scratch, it would end up being custom-built for your needs, would be stronger and last longer, and is probably a better product. But if you mess up assembling an IKEA dresser, worst case scenario you've wasted a few hundred dollars and an afternoon. If you mess up working on your custom cabinet, you've wasted tons of time, materials, money, and you're definitley extremely frustrated. But there are also workarounds when you mess it up, and you can replace a piece rather than replacing an entire piece of furniture which is necessary when your IKEA dresser inevitably crumbles into its constituent pulp. 

Using command line is powerful, and you get to know the ways that your computer is operating in a way that is inaccessible if you stay in the GUI. Things that seem impossible or deeply complex when you try to do them through a software tool might be extremely easy using the command line. Though this may run the other way, as well. So it is imperative that when deciding which route you are going to take (whether we're heading to IKEA or to the lumber yard) that you consider WHY you are choosing that route, and whether it is going to serve your long-term purposes. 

Because sometimes you just need to grab an endtable to toss in the guest bedroom because Mom is coming to visit and something is better than nothing and like heck you're going to build something half-decent from scratch before Friday.
