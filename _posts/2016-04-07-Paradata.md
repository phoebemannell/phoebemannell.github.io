title: A Digital History Mystery - Paradata and Reflection
---

My final project for Digital History is a two-part [Twine](http://twinery.org/) game created in partnership with [Elise Bigley](http://elisebigley.github.io/) in which we take participants through the process of finding, acquiring, assessing, organizing, tidying, and using digtized archival material to address a specific research question. 

And so: [Did Darwin Crib Wallace?: A Digital History Mystery](https://github.com/phoebemannell/DarwinWallaceMystery). 

**Paradata**

We decided to not release just the game, but also the files we used and the edits we did to those files for each step of the process. This was for a couple of reasons. Firstly, some participants might not have time to do all the steps, as some are time-consuming, and they might just want to look at each iteration as they read along with the tutorial. Secondly, because one of the first days of this class we discussed the notion of Open Notebooks, and they ways in which academics can (and should) share not only their final products but also the steps taken from inception to completion. 

We chose to do a Twine game both because we liked the platform and wanted to play with it further, and because we felt that it offered some useful mechanics that would benefit our project. We knew we wanted to offer scaled options for participants so that if they weren't comfortable with a step they could go about it in a different way. We also wanted it to be friendly and interactive, so that participants could be challenged by some trivia questions and also not get knocked back by big walls of text.

As you can see in this image of the framework of my half of the Twine game, there are multiple ways of moving through the content, which allows participants to move through the flow in several different ways depending on their interests and skill level. (For context, the top left square with the thicker border is the beginning) 

In terms of content, a lot of the activities we were demonstrating were pulled from Programming Historian tutorials that we had found both useful and engaging as well as fairly straightforward. I know that I found it tempting to just provide a link to ProgHist, since the authors were able to explain how to do each step better than I felt that I could. But in the end a lot of the material had to be changed considerably from how it was originally presented in the tutorials, and creating the links between the activities was a place where I think some of the best work was done. 

Knowing how to do something is great, but knowing what to do next and what the options are is necessary, because without an express goal to work towards, there isn't really a point to doing the first step. One of my critiques of the ProgHist Internet Archive tutorial was that I didn't know *why* I had downloaded those files, or what I could do with them. So my driving goal with this game was to be clear and blatant about why each step needed to happen, and to elucidate the decision-making process behind the steps we were taking, *and the steps we weren't taking*. 

So the driving question behind all of the actions taken in the game is "How will this help me use these letters to answer the specific question I am posing about Darwin and Wallace?"

**The Frustrations**

Confession: I'm a bit of a perfectionist. 

I am not happy with the product I've put online. I want it to look nicer, I want the flow to be better, and I want to have not spent so much time on mistakes and going down unnecessary rabbit holes. So what am I upset with?

1. I tried to include a stylesheet that would make the twine game prettier, but despite following instructions, I couldn't get it to work. At this point it was starting to get late, and I realized that content mattered more than form, and so I chose to forgo figuring out the problem, left it as it was, and moved on. This was the right choice to make, but part of me wishes I had stayed up all night trying to solve the issue so that it could be pretty. 

2. I spent over four hours working on a section of the twine that I then realized didn't need to exist. I had (for unknown reasons) assumed that importing from the Internet Archive required wget and homebrew and xCode, and after spending ages and a ton of emotional energy trying to understand the processes of downloading and setting up these well enough to be able to explain it clearly, I realized that all I had to do was explain how to use the Python interpreter and pip. Which is a much easier project, and thankfully only took about half an hour to write. 

3. After I published, I realized that the Twine would probably have been richer had I linked it to [my post](http://phoebemannell.github.io/Python/) about my own struggle getting Python to cooperate with me while I was first doing the [Internet Archive tutorial](http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/data-mining-the-internet-archive). This example of troubleshooting and searching for solutions is a valuable thing to share to others who are trying to figure out what they are doing. My instinct is to hide my struggle so that people don't doubt me and my abilities. Failing in public is terrifying. 

4. Despite knowing that sharing my own files was important, I didn't work them into the flow of my Twine sufficiently. I should have included links throughout the tutorial so that there were several moments when the participant could easily go grab the files they needed if something was going wrong or if they didn't want to spend the time working through the step. But I initially I had wanted to passively encourage people to actually **do** the work, thinking that this was the most important part of the project. I've since changed my mind, but I'm going to leave it as it is, for self-preservation so I don't go down yet another rabbit hole, and to force myself to become more comfortable failing in public. 

**The Solutions**

1. Get over it

2. Get over it

3. Get over it

4. Move on. 

**Going Digital**

I noticed a trend in a few of my previous posts. Take a look at these quotes: 

>But really it isn’t the tools or programs that really matter. It’s learning to be comfortable with finding, downloading, and trouble-shooting these sorts of things, so that eventually I will know enough to be able to be critical about the sorts of tools I want to use in the future. I get to learn how my computer really operates and, most importantly, learn enough so that I know what to Google when things go wrong. [Intro](http://phoebemannell.github.io/Intro/)

>Running through solving these errors was almost more educational than the tutorial itself. Problem solving, learning to walk away and let the computer figure itself out, learning what sorts of solutions will or will not work on my particular machine, and discovering that I have to read through and understand scripts if I want them to run properly and give me the results that I am looking for. [Data Mining](http://phoebemannell.github.io/Python/)

What's the trend? Look at who I am talking about. Look at where I'm trying to find my solutions. For some reason, I cannot get out of my head that I have to do this alone. In my non-academic life I am disparaging of those who try to do things on their own without asking for help. I mock their hubris and call them dumb for not consulting with someone who actually knows what they are talking about. And then there was this: 

![Twitter exchange](/images/twitter.png) 

I didn't look at that video for over a week. I felt like the person who was tweeting back at me was judging me for not being able to figure out the SPARQL language. I dumb, inept, and naïve. My inner monologue: 

>"You're bad at computers, why are you even bothering? This is what you get for deciding to make a public website for your posts. Who do you think you are? You don't know enough to pretend that your input is useul." 

Not nice things to say to anyone, so why say it to myself? 

Something I rarely did during the first weeks of the course was ask for help. I would struggle alone until I was frustrated and exhausted, and then when I finally succumbed and put out a call for help, I was too annoyed with the problem to really learn from the solutions that other people offered. 

I am proud of myself for doing better while working on this project. Of course, working with a partner means that you are being held accountable, and you have to have conversations about how things are going, but I also got better at realizing that when I was roadblocked, I could reach out *while* I was trying to find solutions, so that we could work as a team to figure out what the solutions were. We even went so far as to meet up and work together in the very same room, sometimes on the same section, sometimes on different parts, so that it we hit issues, we could talk through how to iron out the problem. 

So much for the myth of digital disconnection. This course has forced me to work more closely with other historians and scholars than I have ever done before in my academic career.
