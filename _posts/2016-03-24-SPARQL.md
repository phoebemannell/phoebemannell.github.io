title: SPARQL!
---

I will admit, I chose to lead this tutorial because the name was cute and I had no idea what anything on the list was. A cute, friendly, unassuming name like SPARQL? Gotta be straight forward and easy-peasy, right?

Wrong. Wolf in sheeps clothing. Not all that sparqls is gold. 

Shawn made sure to check in with me and explain that the language used in SPARQL queries is complex and rather less than intuitive, but that it is predicated on English grammatical structure, and so while the vocab is bonkers, at least the structure is logical. 

The idea of Linked Open Data (LOD) is facinating. I have previously worked quite a bit with Excel (and similar) databases and data structuring software to deal with things like sports tournaments, student information, and (ugh) budgets. One theme common to all of these experiences? Realizing well into the data gathering and ordering process that my initial assumptions about how to organize the spreadsheet is limiting, doesn't do what I need it to do, or necessitates 5 billion steps to do something that *feels* like it should be a simple operation. 

LOD style databases negates this wild struggle by allowing the datum to roam free-range, only to be corralled into columns and rows by specific questions. Like cattle on the range, datum are branded thematically. The queries are designed to round up the cattle and group them in holding pens beside each other in as many ways as you can imagine. What kinds of cattle you grab and how you organize them next to other groups allows you to really know your herd.... I mean... your data... I took the metaphor too far. The point is, you can put a cow next to a steer because it is the same colour, or because it is the same height, or because they have the same parent. The ways you pair up and create/choose relationships to represent between the data-cattle is not predetermined. 

In the [tutorial](http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/graph-databases-and-SPARQL), the author, Matthew Lincoln, uses paintings as his example. Every painting has information about it (metadata) that describes it and its history. Medium, artist, date of creation, country of origin, institution that owns it, etc. If you were to put all of this information into a spreadsheet, it would be difficult to cross-examine these different kinds of information, especially when your research questions become more complex. If you have a corpus of data (in this case about objects), and you want to know how many of each kind of object you have were created by Dutch artists, you can herd your data into the requisite corrals to indicate these relationships. 

But much like with cattle, you kind of have to have a whole whack of background information and experience before you can wrangle them effectively. I'm a digital greenhorn, and there were certainly moments when I felt very much confused and frustrated.

This image, for one, was deeply frustrating, because if I wanted to look at where the prefixes were coming from, and clicked on one of them, the result was:

The way to aquire the necessary prefixes, we figured out in class as we worked through the tutorial as a group, was that you have to know what you are already looking for. The URIs of which they are the short form can be found by searching through the GUI of the database and looking at the metadata for the kinds of items you are hoping to create comparative data-sets for. Which is neither intuitive nor particularly useful for someone who is trying to find links between kinds of data that  may not be readily apparant. 

One of the critiques that is often thrown out about digital history is that it does not problematize the fact that it retains all of the biases that are inherent in research, but rather disguises and obscures these biases. Some of the language in this tutorial and in other uses of SPARQL query language seemed to indicate that the linking of data in such open and diverse ways does away with this kind of bias to some extent. 

>This language is particularly powerful because it does not presuppose the perspectives that users will bring to the data. - Matthew Lincoln

This quote is pulled from the introductory paragraph, and though the claim that the user can reorganize the data in any way that they want is true, the implication is that somehow the data itself is unbiased. However, a human tagged all of the nodes of data, and though the user can create any "edge" or link between these datapoints, they cannot control or even really see the biases of the person who created and made the information available. For historians this can be problematic, for example the original data-tagger might decide that an artist is from a particular nation because that is where they were born, whereas a different person might have felt that the place the artist died or lived the longest was a better indicator of their nationality. This kind of data-tagging might seem insignificant, but if someone is doing a mass pull of data about, for example, Dutch resistance art from the Second World War, the decisions around this metadata could potentially have large impact on the conclusions that the historian makes.   

So not only does the historian/researcher/user retain all of the biases inherent in archival work, since with SPARQL queries the user has to already know what they are looking for, but the impact of the biases of the archivist/data-creator are in some ways increased, unless the user is careful about how they use the tags/nodes. LOD is powerful and extremely useful, but it must be used in ways that are aware of these issues around bias and control of information.
