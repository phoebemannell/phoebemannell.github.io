I am a Public History grad student at Carleton University, studying the history of science and technology and the ways that this history is depicted in various public history spheres. I like boats, maps, and scientific instruments. This love of tech has recently extended itself into the modern era, and I am currently learning how to use computers less inefficiently through digital history tools. Wish me luck!
